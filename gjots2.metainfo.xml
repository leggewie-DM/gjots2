 <summary>A hierarchical note jotter - organise your ideas, notes, facts in a tree</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
gjots2(1) is a simple jotter application for your desktop - an outline processor.
You can use gjots2(1) to organise your jottings into a tree structure,
adding thoughts and miscellany as you go. You can get it to spit out
HTML, XML, postscript, pdf, man etc etc (see the online manual for an
example of the HTML conversion).
  </p>
  <p>
You can use it to "mind-map" your compositions - write down all your
thoughts and then start organising them into a tree. By manipulating
the tree you can easily reorder your thoughts and structure them
appropriately. I use it for all my notes on Unix, my personal bits and
pieces, recipes and even PINs and passwords. I also use it to write
DOCBOOK XML documents.
  </p>
  <p>
gjots2(1) supports the use of ccrypt(1), gpg(1) and openssl(1) to
encrypt and decrypt files. Just make sure the encryption packages that
you want to use are installed as they are not all a standard part of
all Linux distributions.
