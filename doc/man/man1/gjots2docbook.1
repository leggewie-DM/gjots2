.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gjots2docbook
converts a gjotsfile into DOCBOOK XML.
.P
.B gjots2docbook
uses
.BR awk (1)
to perform the conversion.
.P
.B gjots2docbook
does not create them so the first element in the file should contain
any <bookinfo> or <artheader> element. Similarly, <bibliographic>
elements are not created. In fact the output is very simplistic with
item titles in the
.B gjotsfile
being converted to chapter or section headings in DOCBOOK. There is no
reason why your gjotsfile should not contain valid DOCBOOK XML - and
that is why the -e and -p options are provided.
.P
If the file does not start with <?xml ...> then appropriate lines will
be added as follows:
.P
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
.br
<!DOCTYPE doc_type PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN">
.fi
.RE
.P
If properly installed, the docbook utilities can then be used to create HTML, 
man, ps, pdf etc files eg:
.P
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
gjots2docbook -b ~/.gjotsfile >gjotsfile.xml
.br
docbook2pdf gjotsfile.xml
